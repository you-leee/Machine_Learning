1.) Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.
	- In a neural network with many layers, we think of each successive layer as being able to use the earlier layers as features, so as to be able to compute increasingly complex functions.
	- If a neural network is overfitting the data, one solution would be to increase the regularization parameter λ.
	
2.) Consider the following neural network which takes two binary-valued inputs x1,x2∈{0,1} and outputs hΘ(x). Which of the following logical functions does it (approximately) compute? 
+1 ->  30 ->
x1 -> -20 -> h(x)
x2 -> -20 ->
	- NAND
	
3.) Consider the neural network given below. Which of the following equations correctly computes the activation a1(3)? Note: g(z) is the sigmoid activation function.
+1 -> a11 -> a21 ->
x1 -> a12 -> a22 -> h(x)
x2 -> a13 -> a23 ->
	- a1(3)=g(Θ1,0(2)*a0(2)+Θ1,1(2)*a1(2)+Θ1,2(2)*a2(2))
	
4.) You have the following neural network:
+1 -> a11 ->
x1 -> a12 -> h(x)
x2 -> a13 ->
You'd like to compute the activations of the hidden layer a(2)∈R3. One way to do so is the following Octave code. You want to have a vectorized implementation of this (i.e., one that does not use for loops). Which of the following implementations correctly compute a(2)? Check all that apply.

a2 = zeros(3,1);
for i=1:3
	for j=1:3
		a2(i) = a2(i) + x(j)*theta1(i,j);
	end
	a2(i) = sigmoid(a2(i));
end

	- z = Theta1 * x; a2 = sigmoid (z);
	- a2 = sigmoid (Theta1 * x);
	
5.) You are using the neural network pictured below and have learned the parameters Θ(1)=[1, −1.5, 3.7; 1, 5.1, 2.3] (used to compute a(2)) and Θ(2)=[1, 0.6, −0.8] (used to compute a(3)} as a function of a(2)). Suppose you swap the parameters for the first hidden layer between its two units so Θ(1)=[1, 5.1, 2.3; 1, −1.5, 3.7] and also swap the output layer so Θ(2)=[1, −0.8, 0.6]. How will this change the value of the output hΘ(x)?
+1 ->  +1 ->
x1 -> a12 -> h(x)
x2 -> a13 ->
	- It will stay the same.
