1.) For the training set given above, what is the value of m? In the box below, please enter your answer (which should be a number between 0 and 10).
	- 4

2.)Consider the following training set of m=4 training examples:
   x   	   y   
   1    	   0.5   
   2    	   1   
   4    	   2   
   0    	   0   

Consider the linear regression model hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x. What are the values of θ0 and θ1 that you would expect to obtain upon running gradient descent on this model? (Linear regression will be able to fit this data perfectly.)
	- Q0=0, Q1=0.5
	
3.)Suppose we set θ0=−1,θ1=2 in the linear regression hypothesis from Q1. What is hθ(6)?
	-11
	
4.)Let f be some function so that f(θ0,θ1) outputs a number. For this problem, f is some arbitrary/unknown smooth function (not necessarily the cost function of linear regression, so f may have local optima). Suppose we use gradient descent to try to minimize f(θ0,θ1) as a function of θ0 and θ1. 
Which of the following statements are true? (Check all that apply.)
	-If the learning rate is too small, then gradient descent may take a very long time to converge.
	-If θ0 and θ1 are initialized at a local minimum, then one iteration will not change their values.
	
5.)Suppose that for some linear regression problem (say, predicting housing prices as in the lecture), we have some training set, and for our training set we managed to find some θ0, θ1 such that J(θ0,θ1)=0.
Which of the statements below must then be true? (Check all that apply.)
	-Our training set can be fit perfectly by a straight line, i.e., all of our training examples lie perfectly on some straight line.
